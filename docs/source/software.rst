This page collects some useful software developed by our group members.

AnalysisHelpers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Developed by Maurizio along many years of analysis activity, it provides some useful
functions to manipulate ROOT objects in python. It is particularly useful to prepare
LHCb-style plots, declare histograms and trees, and run RooFit fits in a shorter number
of commands than usual. `AnalysisHelpers <https://gitlab.cern.ch/mamartin/AnalysisHelpers>`_ (`API <https://maurizios-analysis-helpers.docs.cern.ch>`_)

PlotUtils
^^^^^^^^^
A collection of helpful functions and classes for plotting pretty graphs.. the most important aspect of any analysis. `PlotUtils <https://github.com/eddieshields/PlotUtils>`_

ToyExperimentHelper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A Framework that can be used to perform Toy experiments in ROOT easily. `ToyExperimentHelper <https://github.com/simeloni/ToyExperimentHelper>`_
